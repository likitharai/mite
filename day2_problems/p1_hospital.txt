`1. Hospital Billing System (Using Functions & Decision-Making)`
`Problem Statement:`  
A hospital needs a program to calculate a patient’s bill 
based on `ward type and number of days admitted.`  

1. `Charges per Day:`  
   - General Ward → ₹1000  
   - Semi-Private → ₹2000  
   - Private → ₹5000  
2. `If the patient stays for more than 7 days, 
they get a `5% discount` on the total bill.  
3. Use `functions` for bill calculation.  

`Requirements:`  
- `Input:`  
  - Patient Name  
  - Ward Type (General/Semi-Private/Private)  
  - Number of Days Admitted  
- `Output:`  
  - Total Bill (Before and After Discount)  

`Function Prototype Example:`  
```c
float calculateBill(char wardType, int days);
```
