`1. Memory Management for Student Marks (Using Dynamic Memory Allocation)`
`Problem Statement:`  
A school wants to dynamically allocate memory 
for `N students` and store their `marks` using `malloc()`.  

1. Read `N` studentsâ€™ marks.  
2. Find the `average marks`.  
3. Free the allocated memory using `free()`.  

`Function Prototype Example:`  
```c
void inputMarks(int *marks, int n);
float calculateAverage(int *marks, int n);
```

`Sample Test Case:`  
`Input:`  
```plaintext
Enter number of students: 3  
Enter marks: 78 85 90  
```
`Output:`  
```plaintext
Average Marks: 84.33  
```
