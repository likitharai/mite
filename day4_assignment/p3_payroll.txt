`3. Employee Payroll System`  
`Scenario:`  
A `company` maintains employee salary details, 
including `Emp ID, Name, Basic Salary, and Allowances`. 
The system should:  
- Store and compute `Gross Salary (Basic + Allowances)`  
- Save payroll data to a `file`  
- Allow `retrieval of an employee's salary`  

`Input Example:`  
```
Enter number of employees: 2
Employee 1: 501, Alice, ₹50000, ₹10000
Employee 2: 502, Bob, ₹60000, ₹12000

Enter Employee ID to search: 501
```

`Output Example:`  
```
Employee: Alice
Gross Salary: ₹60000
Record saved in "payroll.txt"
```
