`2. Warehouse Stock Management`  
`Scenario:`  
A `warehouse` stores items in a `stack-based system` (Last-In-First-Out). The system should:  
- Add new items to the `top of the stack`  
- Process `dispatches from the top`  
- Show `remaining stock`  

`Operations Example:`  
```
Stock Added: Item A  
Stock Added: Item B  
Stock Added: Item C  

Dispatching Item: C  
Remaining Stock: A, B
