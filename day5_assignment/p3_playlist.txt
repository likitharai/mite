`3. Playlist Management System`  
`Scenario:`  
A `music streaming app` maintains a `playlist` using a `circular linked list`. The system should:  
- Allow `"Next Song"` navigation  
- Loop `back to the first song after the last song`  
- Display `currently playing song`  

`Operations Example:`  
```
Current Song: Song A  
Next Song: Song B  
Next Song: Song C  
Next Song: Song A  (Looped back)  
```
