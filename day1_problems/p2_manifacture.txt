`2. Manufacturing Quality Control`  
`Scenario:`  
A manufacturing unit inspects `product weights` 
before packaging. A product is `accepted` 
if its weight is `within the range of 950g to 1050g`.  
Write a program to process `N` product weights and display:  
- `Accepted Products Count`  
- `Rejected Products Count`  

`Input Example:`  
```
Enter number of products: 5
Enter weights (in grams): 970 890 1055 1000 1020
```

`Output Example:`  
```
Accepted Products: 3
Rejected Products: 2
```
