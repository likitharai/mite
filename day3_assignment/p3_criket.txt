`3. Cricket Scoreboard System`  
`Scenario:`  
A `cricket club` records match scores in an array. 
The system should:  
- Find the `highest and lowest score`  
- Calculate the `average score`  

Use `arrays` for data storage and `looping techniques` for computation.

`Input Example:`  
```
Enter scores of 5 matches: 245 189 320 270 150
```

`Output Example:`  
```
Highest Score: 320
Lowest Score: 150
Average Score: 234.8
```
