3. Emergency Ambulance Dispatch System`  
`Scenario:`  
A `hospital dispatch center` needs to assign ambulances based on the shortest distance. The system should:  
- Maintain `a list of ambulances and distances`  
- Use `selection sort` to sort ambulances by distance  
- Assign the `nearest ambulance` to the patient  

`Operations Example:`  
```
Ambulances (Distance in km): [10, 3, 7, 1, 5]
Sorted: [1, 3, 5, 7, 10]
Nearest Ambulance Assigned: Distance 1 km
```
