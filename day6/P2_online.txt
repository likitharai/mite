`2. Online Shopping â€“ Price Sorting & Search`  
`Scenario:`  
An `e-commerce` website allows users to sort and search for products. The system should:  
- Sort `products based on price` (ascending)  
- Allow `binary search` for a product by name  
- Display `the cheapest and most expensive product`  

`Operations Example:`  
```
Input: 
[{"Name": "Laptop", "Price": 50000}, 
 {"Name": "Mobile", "Price": 20000}, 
 {"Name": "Headphones", "Price": 5000}]

Sorted by Price: Headphones (5000), Mobile (20000), Laptop (50000)
Search 'Mobile': Found (Price: 20000)
```
