`1. Election Vote Count (Using Arrays)`
`Problem Statement:`  
A city conducts an election with `5 candidates`. 
Citizens cast their votes (numbers `1 to 5` representing candidates). 
Write a program to:  
1. Read `N` votes into an array.  
2. Count the total votes for each candidate.  
3. Determine the `winner` (candidate with the highest votes).  

`Function Prototypes:`  
```c
void countVotes(int votes[], int n, int candidateVotes[]);
int findWinner(int candidateVotes[]);
```

`Sample Test Case:`  
`Input:`  
```plaintext
Enter number of votes: 10  
Enter votes (1-5): 1 2 2 3 1 4 2 5 1 1  
```
`Output:`  
```plaintext
Candidate 1: 4 votes  
Candidate 2: 3 votes  
Candidate 3: 1 vote  
Candidate 4: 1 vote  
Candidate 5: 1 vote  
Winner: Candidate 1  
```vote
